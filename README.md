# Hip-Hop-Trivia

**Stakes are high, but can you rise above 3 feet? From the state of New York to a Buhloone Minstate. RIP Trugoy the Dove but De La Soul will never die. This iconic Long Island trio were the original A.I. Hip Hop Trivia, the De La Soul Edition.

### I've started white boarding in my Trello, coming up with puedo code/ideas for this project.

### Genesis

**My original idea was to do a Hip Hop Hang Man but it turned into a trivia with other editions to come.

**I did want a music app playing in the background but I got caught up with coding and trying to figure out the stick figure that adding additional code/work would be an afterthought. So I pivoted towards a trivia game. 

**I did search google for Hang Man games to get an idea of how to start my game but most of the code/repos were outdated and not fully functional. I did rely on Office Hours and help from my peers.
