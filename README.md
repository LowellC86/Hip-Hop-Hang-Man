# Hip-Hop-Hang-Man
**"Think you can hang without getting hung?" Hip Hop Hang Man is a fun and interactive take on the classic Hang Man game but with a Hip Hop twist. Can you guess the title to Nas' classic debut? Or how about the borough Jay-Z was born and raised in? Hip Hop Hang Man, come hang with me.**   
### I've started white boarding in my Trello, coming up with puedo code/ideas for this project.
